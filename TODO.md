- change frontend to use the angular built in HttpClient
  => rebuild frontend fully?
  Option to implement all the frontend points in one go

- change frontend to use a service for the Playlist instead of renewing it every time
- change backend to get the current songs after every song
- update the Songslist actively on the frontend whenever an Update is available in the Backend
  => server sent events

Future ideas:

- Have a look into making the software available for multiple sessions from different users
